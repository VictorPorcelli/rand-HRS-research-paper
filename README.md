Final research paper from a graduate course at Wagner on how gender affects reported rates of depression in older adults.

This research used RAND's Health and Retirement Survey, a national panel survey of individuals over 50 years old and their spouses intended to inform research and policymaking related to aging populations. Using STATA, myself and my classmates used a linear probability model (LPM) to analyze the effect of gender on reported rates on depression. We hypothesized that women report higher rates of depression than men due to American cultural standards.

Across various models, we find gender to be significant at the 1% level albeit with a relatively low magnitude (about a 1.5% increase in likelihood of reporting depression).
